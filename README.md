# Identity Mapping Project: MapMyIdentity.com
================

## Description

The Identity Mapping Project (IMP) features an application assessing online media users'
expressions of identity across various digital platforms, sites, and immersive environments.

Participants in the study will follow a basic flow through the application:

1. **Survey Part I:** Participants will fill out the following sets of information:
  * Basic information about the Physical Self (such as age, sex, education, and country of residence)
  * A broad overview of participants' presence in each of six digital domains: Blogs, On-Line Forums, Social Networks, Digital Gaming Platforms, 3D Virtual Worlds, and Emails.

2. **Survey Part II:** Participants will provide more detailed information about their involvement in each digital domain where they currently have a presence.

3. **Survey Part III:** This portion will explain the concept of “Crossover Accounts” and find out if participants have any crossover accounts in their digital identities.

4. **Identity Map:** Participants will be shown a graphical representation of their digital identity and how they compare to others around the world.
