## Description

The Identity Mapping Project (IMP) features an application assessing online media users'
expressions of identity across various digital platforms, sites, and immersive environments.

Participants in the study will follow a basic flow through the application:
1. **Survey Part I:** Participants will fill out basic information about their activity in a variety of today's largest digital venues like Facebook, Twitter, SecondLife, and others.
2. **Survey Part II:** Participants will elaborate on their usages indicated in the first portion of the survey and describe their digital identity management.
3. **Identity Map:** Participants will be shown a graphical representation of their digital identity and how they compare to others around the world.
